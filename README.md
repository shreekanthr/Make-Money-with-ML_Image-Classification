This project has been inspired from an awesome course by Siraj Raval.

This image classifier has been built using TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for ML, so that you can train your own objects on the fly using just a browser. It makes use of a technique called Transfer Learning that leverages pre-trained models. The pre-trained model architecture used here is MobileNet and the classification technique is KNN.

Feel free to download and test it. Any feedback on improvement or if you would like to see additional capabilities built in are very welcome.
